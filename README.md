# java-cli-maven-postgres-str-concat

## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.
Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins
`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`. Added clustered indexes on
`dog`.breedId and `dog`.colorId. Turned `dog_expanded` into a view with an
implicit index on `dog_expanded`.id. Using recursion and common table expression with the aggregate function
COUNT, create a new view `breed_count`. Create a new view `dog_final` based on `breed_count` adding concated color column. All output normally seen in a terminal will be in `java-srv/log` which will dump to the screen.
The project may seem to hang but the logs from the container must be written to the project this can take up to 3 min.
